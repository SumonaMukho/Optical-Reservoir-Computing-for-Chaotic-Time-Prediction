# Optical-Reservoir-Computing-for-Chaotic-Time-Prediction
I tried a prediction of Mackey-Glass equation, which is chaotic time system, by optical reservoir computing model.
The model is implemented with the paper, Jonathan Dong et al "Optical Reservoir Computing Using Multiple Light Scattering for Chaotic Systems Prediction" IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics 26, 1(2019)
